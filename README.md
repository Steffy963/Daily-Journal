# Daily-Journal 
ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Stephy from New Zealand. I recently graduated in Computer and Information Science from Auckland University, and I'm embarking on a fantastic journey into the technology field. As there were no major projects in my studies, I took the initiative to develop a small project on my own - a Daily Journal Site using JS, Node.js, and Ejs - to improve my knowledge.

During my university studies, I discovered a particular interest in Highly Secure Systems, especially with cryptography. I am enthusiastic about getting the opportunity to learn and develop further in this field.
