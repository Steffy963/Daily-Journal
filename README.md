# Daily-Journal 

As there were no major projects in my studies, I took the initiative to develop a small project on my own - a Daily Journal Site using language JS, Node.js, and Ejs - to improve my knowledge.
The site features the ability to add contents to the home page with a database. It includes sections for the home page, about, and contact us. Additionally, I deployed the search page with options to search by title.
Currently, I am working on the contact us page to establish a connection to SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) to enable the retrieval and handling of details submitted through the contact form.
